Cost Savings: Eliminates the need for upfront capital. Users can pay for resources on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Security: Advanced encryption, identity and access management, and compliance certiﬁcations to ensure data safety.
Global Reach: Cloud services are available globally. No need to provision infrastructures physically everywhere.
Data Loss and Recovery: Cloud services oﬀer automatic backups, redundancy, and disaster recovery.
Resource Underutilization: Traditional data centers suﬀer from underutilized resources due to overprovisioning. Cloud providers optimize resource allocation and utilization.
High Initial Costs: Traditional computing models require signiﬁcant upfront investments in hardware and software licenses. Cloud computing eliminates these needs.
